Introduction
============

This notebook works with daily data on Covid-19 cases by country and
region.  It will fit a simple model to predict growth rates. Note that
this model is intended for teaching, and its projections should be
taken with a grain of salt.

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn import (
        linear_model, metrics, neural_network, pipeline, model_selection, preprocessing
    )
    from pandas_datareader import wb # Use WorldBank data from pandas-datareader

    %matplotlib inline
    # activate plot theme
    import qeds
    qeds.themes.mpl_style();    


Data
====

Corona Virus Cases
------------------

We will use data from `Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems
Science and
Engineering <https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>`_ . It is
gathered from a variety of sources and updated daily. JHU CSSE uses
the data for `this interactive
website. <https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html>`_

JHU CSSE has the data on github. It gets updated daily.

.. code-block:: python

    confirmed = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv')
    deaths = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv')
    recoveries = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv')

    ids = ["Province/State","Country/Region", "Lat","Long"]
    confirmed=confirmed.melt(id_vars=ids, var_name="Date", value_name="cases")
    deaths=deaths.melt(id_vars=ids,var_name="Date", value_name="deaths")
    recoveries=recoveries.melt(id_vars=ids,var_name="Date", value_name="recoveries")

    covid = pd.merge(confirmed, deaths, on=ids.append("Date"), how='outer')
    covid = pd.merge(covid, recoveries, on=ids.append("Date"), how='left')

    covid["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(covid["Date"])
    covid["Province/State"]=covid["Province/State"].fillna("")

   covid.groupby("Country/Region").get_group("Canada").groupby("Province/State").tail(1)
   country=covid.groupby(["Country/Region","Date"]).sum()
       

World Bank Data
---------------

We are going to try to predict the spread of Covid from country
characteristics. We will use data from the World Bank, through
the World Bank API from `pandas-datareader <https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readers/world-bank.html>`_

We will use the following indicators. You may want to modify them.
Thereâ€™s a table of indicators on `the World Bank
website. <http://wdi.worldbank.org/tables>`_


.. code-block:: python

    # list of indicators we'll use
    ind_use = [
        # Population
        "SP.POP.TOTL", "SP.POP.DPND.OL",
        "SP.POP.DPND.YG", "EN.POP.DNST",
        "BG.GSR.NFSV.GD.ZS","SP.URB.GROW",
        "SP.URB.TOTL",
        # Economic
        "NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG",
        # Migration & Remittances
        "SM.POP.TOTL", "BX.TRF.PWKR.CD.DT",
        "BM.TRF.PWKR.CD.DT",
        # Tourism
        "ST.INT.ARVL",
        "ST.INT.RCPT.CD",
        "ST.INT.XPND.CD",
        # Health care
        "SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD",
        "SH.XPD.OOPC.CH.ZS",
        "SH.MED.PHYS.ZS",
        "SH.MED.NUMW.P3",
        # Health, comorbitites
        "SH.PRV.SMOK.MA",
        "SH.PRV.SMOK.FE",
        "SH.TBS.INCD",
        "SH.STA.DIAB.ZS",
        "SP.DYN.LE00.IN",
        ]

We now download these indicators from World Bank and merge with the Covid data.

.. code-block:: python

    import os.path
    import warnings

    wdifile='./wdi.pkl'
    if (os.path.isfile(wdifile)) :
        warnings.warn("Reading WDI data from disk. You probably do not want this if you have modified ind_use.")
        wdi = pd.read_pickle(wdifile)
    else :
        def fixcountrynames(s):
            trans = { "Egypt, Arab Rep.":"Egypt",
            "Slovak Republic":"Slovakia",
            "Brunei Darussalam":"Brunei",
            "United States":"US",
            "Iran, Islamic Rep.":"Iran",
            "Korea, Rep.":"Korea, South",
            "Czech Republic":"Czechia",
            "Russian Federation":"Russia",
            "Congo, Dem. Rep.":"Congo (Kinshasa)",
            "Venezuela, RB":"Venezuela",
            "St. Lucia":"Saint Lucia",
            "St. Vincent and the Grenadines":"Saint Vincent and the Grenadines",
            "Congo, Rep.":"Republic of the Congo",
            "Bahamas, The":"The Bahamas",
            "Gambia, The":"The Gambia"}
            for t in trans :
                s["Country/Region"] = s["Country/Region"].replace(t, trans[t])
            return(s)

        wdi = covid.drop(columns=["Date","Province/State","Lat","Long","cases","deaths","recoveries"]).drop_duplicates()
        for id in ind_use :
            s=wb.download(indicator=id, country="all", start=2005, end=2019).reset_index()

            # use most recent non missing value
            s=s.dropna().groupby("country").last()
            s=s.drop(columns="year").reset_index()

            # match country names to covid data
            s=s.rename(columns={"country":"Country/Region"})
            s=fixcountrynames(s)
            wdi=pd.merge(wdi, s, how='left', on='Country/Region', validate="one_to_one")
        wdi.to_pickle(wdifile)


.. code-block:: python

    cvwdi=pd.merge(country.reset_index(), wdi, how='left', on="Country/Region", validate="many_to_one")
    cvwdi.info()



Predicting growth rates
=======================

We will now try to predict the daily growth rate in cases from current
cases and country characteristics. Our model will predict that
countries with similar characteristics will have similar case growth
rates given current cases.

.. code-block:: python

    def prepdata(cvwdi=cvwdi, lags=0, includedays=True, casemin=0):
        df=cvwdi.set_index("Date")
        df=df.query(f"cases >= {casemin}")
        df["case_growth_rate"]=-df.groupby("Country/Region")["cases"].diff(-1)/df["cases"]

        for l in range(lags) :
            df[f"case_L{l+1}"] = df.groupby("Country/Region")["cases"].shift(l)

        df = df.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan)
        # Drop indicators that are missing often and/or not useful
        df= df.drop(columns=["Lat","Long"])
        df=df.dropna()
        df = df.reset_index()
        if (includedays):
            df["daysfromstart"] = (df["Date"] - df["Date"].min()).dt.days
        df=df.set_index(["Country/Region","Date"])
        X = df.drop(columns=["case_growth_rate","recoveries","deaths"]).copy()
        for col in list(X):
            X[col] = X[col].astype(float)

        y = df["case_growth_rate"]

        return(X,y)

   X, y = prepdata(cvwdi)

.. code-block::python

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.hist(y, bins=25, range=(y.min(), 4))
    ax.set_title("Histogram of Growth Rates")
    ax.set_xlabel("Daily Growth Rate")
    ax.set_ylabel("Count")

Since we our data has a time dimension, and we want to use our model
to predict the future, we should create test and training subsets that
reflect this. Rather than splitting observations randomly (like
:code:`model_selection.train_test_split`), we will use the 3 most
recent days as a test sample and the remaining for training.

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import timedelta

    def panel_train_test_split(X,y, testdays=5):
        lastday = X.reset_index()["Date"].max()
        cutoff = lastday - timedelta(days=testdays)
        X_test = X.query(f'Date > "{cutoff}"')
        X_train = X.query(f'Date <= "{cutoff}"')
        y_test = y[X_test.index]
        y_train = y[X_train.index]
        return(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = panel_train_test_split(X,y, testdays=3)
    len(y), len(y_train), len(y_test)

To begin with, we will use Lasso to predict growth rates. You may want
to experiment with other prediction methods.

.. code-block:: python

    mod=pipeline.make_pipeline(
        preprocessing.StandardScaler(),  # this will do the input scaling
        linear_model.LassoCV(cv=5)       # put your favorite model here
    )
    mod.fit(X_train,y_train)
    dict(mse_train=metrics.mean_squared_error(y_train, mod.predict(X_train)),
         mse_test=metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, mod.predict(X_test)))


From the Lasso coefficients, we can somewhat understand the implications for case growth.

.. code-block:: python

    lasso_coefs = pd.Series(dict(zip(list(X), mod.steps[1][1].coef_)))
    lasso_coefs

The only features that will vary over time are the date and the number
of cases. We see that we have positive coefficient on date. The growth
rate has tended to increase over time. Note that even with a constant
growth rate, the growth of the number of cases is exponential and will
quickly become extremely large.

However, offsetting the positive date coefficient is a negative
coefficient on cases. As the number of cases increases, the growth
rate slows down. This is a typical feature of models of
epidemics. Eventually everyone who can get infected is infected and
the growth in cases plateaus.  It is somewhat neat that this feature
of epidemiological model shows up in the data just from our simple
prediction model.

Fit of Predictions
------------------

.. code-block:: python

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    tmp = y.reset_index()
    colors = qeds.themes.COLOR_CYCLE
    ax.scatter(tmp["Date"],tmp["case_growth_rate"], color=colors[0], label='observed')
    ax.scatter(X_train.reset_index()["Date"],mod.predict(X_train), color=colors[1],alpha=0.6, label='predicted, training')
    ax.scatter(X_test.reset_index()["Date"],mod.predict(X_test), color=colors[2],alpha=0.6, label='predicted, test')
    ax.set_ylim((0,2))
    ax.legend()
    ax.set_title("Observed and Predicted Case Growth Rates")
    ax.set_ylabel("Daily Case Growth Rate")
    ax.set_xlabel("Date")
    ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(rotation=60)

Looking at predicted growth rates vs date, the model seems to be doing
a reasonable job. The predicted growth rates are within a reasonable
range. Notice the general increasing trend in growth rates. This will
make the longer term predictions of the model look quite dire.

.. code-block:: python

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.scatter(X["cases"],y, color=colors[0],label='observed')
    ax.scatter(X_train["cases"],mod.predict(X_train), color=colors[1],alpha=0.7,label='predicted, training')
    ax.scatter(X_test["cases"],mod.predict(X_test), color=colors[2], alpha=0.7, label='predicted, test')
    ax.legend()
    ax.set_ylim((0,2))
    ax.set_title("Observed and Predicted Case Growth Rates")
    ax.set_ylabel("Daily Case Growth Rate")
    ax.set_xlabel("Current Cases")
    ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(rotation=60)

The fit of predictions versus current cases are not quite so good. We
see that the model often overpredicts growth rates for cases between
roughly one and ten thousand. This is likely driven by the few large
growth rates that can occur with very few cases. Our model might be
improved by letting current cases enter more flexibly.


Predicted Case Trajectories
---------------------------

Our model gives a prediction of the growth rate of cases from today to
tomorrow as a function of current cases and country
characteristics. We can use the model to predict cases multiple days
into the future by repeatedly predicting growth given cases, updating
cases, and repeating.

.. code-block:: python

    def predict_path(x0, mod, days=28):
        x = x0
        y = np.zeros(days+1)
        y[0] = x["cases"]
        for d in range(days) :
            y[d+1] = (mod.predict(x)+1)*x["cases"]
            # update x
            l = 1
            while (f"cases_L{l}" in x.columns):
                if l==1 :
                    x[f"cases_L{l}"] = x["cases"]
                else :
                    x[f"cases_L{l}"] = x[f"cases_L{l-1}"]
                l = l+1
            x["cases"]=y[d+1]
            if ("daysfromstart" in x.columns):
                x["daysfromstart"]=x["daysfromstart"]+1

        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.plot(range(len(y)),y)
        ax.set_title(f"Predicted Cases in {country}")
        ax.set_xlabel('days from now')
        ax.set_ylabel('cases')
        return(y, fig, ax)

   country="Canada"
   yhat, fig, ax=predict_path(X.xs(country).tail(1).copy(), mod, days=30)

Note that we are taking a model trained to predict one day ahead and
using it to predict 30 days into the future. This is asking an awful
lot of the model. Also, we have seen above some obvious deficiencies
in model fit. Therefore, these predictions come with some large
caveats. Nonetheless, they do give some idea how the number of cases
might grow if Corona virus spreads in Canada in a similar way to it
has elsewhere.
